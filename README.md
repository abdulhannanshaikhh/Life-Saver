## 📘 About the Project

**LifeSaver** is a real-time, scalable web application designed to transform the way blood donation and inventory is managed. Built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**, this platform serves as a digital bridge between **donors, recipients, and blood banks**.

The system enables **secure user authentication**, **real-time inventory updates**, and **role-based dashboards** to provide transparency and efficiency in blood donation management.
